                agriculture is all about.<br>
                During your stay in the farm<br>- alongside woofers from other Countries and with visits ranging from a
                few days to several months - <br>the host will provide accommodation and opportunities to learn about
                organic and self-sufficient lifestyles;<br> in returns of an average of five to six hours farming or
                gardening activities.<br>Please, note this is not a monetary exchange program, but merely an educational
                one.
