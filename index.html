                What is WWOOFing?
            </h2>
            <p> WWOOFing stands for "World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms".<br>The volunteer or woofer gets the
                op-portunity to spend time in an organic farm, learn what itâ€™s like, how it works and what sustainable
                agriculture is all about.<br>
                During your stay in the farm<br>- alongside woofers from other Countries and with visits ranging from a
                few days to several months - <br>the host will provide accommodation and opportunities to learn about
                organic and self-sufficient lifestyles;<br> in returns of an average of five to six hours farming or
                gardening activities.<br>Please, note this is not a monetary exchange program, but merely an educational
                one.

                <p>The Torsi family villa was built in the 1870, originally on a land of just 50 yards with just a
                    couple of
                    olives trees and a small barn at the back.<br>Today this stunning villa comprises all the
                    commodities of the 21st century as well as some original features too.<br>Accommodation will be
                    provided across its 12rooms to all of our lovely guests grape-escaping from the city buzz and a
                    frenetic lifestyle, or willing to join us to simply enjoy some good wine and time in the Italian
                    countryside.

                <p>Either as a beginner or a Woofing veteran all that the Torsi family wishes for you is to have a great
                    time and get involved in their small #community# to really capture the essence of this beautiful
                    Italian region, whilst learning about grape harvesting and wine making.<br> Although we won't hide
                    that nowadays the Villa needs some extra love and attention, and we will gratefully welcome little
                    renovation works from any volunteers that wish to do so.</p>
